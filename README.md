# Django Commons

Django Commons is an organization dedicated to supporting the
community's efforts to maintain packages. It seeks to improve the
maintainence experience for all contributors; reducing the barrier
to entry for new contributors and reducing overhead for existing
maintainers.

Django Commons has lofty goals for the future, but will only be
possible with your help:

- Compensate maintainers
- Identify and announce packages needing help
- Normalize and support maintainers periodically stepping back
- Support and encourage new contributors to step up

## FAQ

### What is each respository team for?

There are three teams for each repository. They each have different
permissions.

- [project-name]
- [project-name]-committers
- [project-name]-admins

The general team [project-name] gives you triage permissions (assign issues, labels, etc).

The [project-name]-committers gives you permission to merge pull requests and push to main.
They are people who generally maintain the project.

The [project-name]-admins gives you permissions to administrate the GitHub repo and release new versions to PyPI.
This may be the same group of people that are on [project-name]-commiters.

### Who can work on a project?

Anyone can fork any project and work on any issue. All projects within Django Commons are community
